The idea is to have a Facebook app, that lists a number of different coffees, along with their recipes. The app would use the Open Graph, to allow users to share these coffees, as well as their recipes.

Proposed Objects
-----------------

-Coffee. A generic object, that can then be given any value. Of course, the value would be a particular type of coffee, such as espresso, latte, Irish coffee, and so on.

-Recipe. Another generic object. This would be used in conjunction with the Share action. 

Proposed Actions
-----------------

-Love. This will be similar to the Like button. 
-Drink. The idea is that if you've drunk a particular coffee today, you can click "Drink" - a story would then be published on your Timeline, and in the Tickr and News Feed.
-Make. This would be used mainly to share coffee recipes.

Initial Workflow
-----------------

At first, the user would be prompted to log in using Facebook - the Facebook Javascript SDK would be used for authentication. We would be asking for a few permissions - namely basic_info, as well as publish_stream. Next, the user would be taken to a list of different coffees. Clicking on any of these coffees would open up a detail page, which gives more information about the coffee, as well as the recipe. There would be different sections here. One section has information about the coffee - it would also contain the Like and Drink buttons. Clicking on any of these buttons generates a corresponding story on the user's Timeline. Another section would list the recipe, along with the Make button - clicking the Make button generates a corresponding story. 

Bootstrap and jQuery would be used. A lot. 

Hosting
--------

Costs are obviously a constraint. In choosing a hosting partner, what also matters, is the kind of hosting model, and the ease of use associated with it. At this point of time, it seems to be a great idea to use AppHarbor for deploying the app in production. It's free plan is suited for our app, which wouldnt need to scale up so soon. Further, AppHarbor is closely integrated with GitHub, so a push to the master branch in the GitHub repo would automatically trigger a build in AppHarbor. Hosting the app in a bucket in Amazon S3 is also an option worth exploring.


Progress
---------

-- Setting up base Facebook authentication - DONE.
-- Defining actions and objects in the Facebook Developer Console - DONE.
-- Constructing pages for different coffees and their recipes
-- Adding buttons for posting actions, and metadata tags for objects
-- Theming the app using jQuery Bootstrap
-- Deployment to AppHarbor
