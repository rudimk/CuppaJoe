CuppaJoe
========

CuppaJoe is a sample Facebook app in the pipeline, that uses the Facebook Open Graph to let you share your favorite coffees, as well as the recipes for creating those amazing cups of joy! It's also intended to be a demo for writing Facebook apps with Javascript - future versions would demo the usage of Node.js as well.

CuppaJoe is currently under active planning, and the first commits will be made in the next 2 weeks; an initial release is expected in the next 4 weeks. The link for the app would be included here.
