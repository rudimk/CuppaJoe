The idea is to have a Facebook app, that lists a number of different coffees, along with their recipes. The app would use the Open Graph, to allow users to share these coffees, as well as their recipes.

Proposed Objects
-----------------

-Coffee. A generic object, that can then be given any value. Of course, the value would be a particular type of coffee, such as espresso, latte, Irish coffee, and so on.

-Recipe. Another generic object. This would be used in conjunction with the Share action. 

Proposed Actions
-----------------

-Like. This will be similar to the Like button. The action used would be the built-in Like action in the Open Graph.
-Drink. The idea is that if you've drunk a particular coffee today, you can click "Drink" - a story would then be published on your Timeline, and in the Tickr and News Feed.
-Share. This would be used mainly to share coffee recipes.
