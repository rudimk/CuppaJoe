The idea is to have a Facebook app, that lists a number of different coffees, along with their recipes. The app would use the Open Graph, to allow users to share these coffees, as well as their recipes.

Proposed Objects
-----------------

-Coffee. A generic object, that can then be given any value. Of course, the value would be a particular type of coffee, such as espresso, latte, Irish coffee, and so on.

-Recipe. Another generic object. This would be used in conjunction with the Share action. 

Proposed Actions
-----------------

-Love. This will be similar to the Like button. 
-Drink. The idea is that if you've drunk a particular coffee today, you can click "Drink" - a story would then be published on your Timeline, and in the Tickr and News Feed.
-Make. This would be used mainly to share coffee recipes.

Initial Workflow
-----------------

At first, the user would be prompted to log in using Facebook - the Facebook Javascript SDK would be used for authentication. We would be asking for a few permissions - namely basic_info, as well as publish_stream. Next, the user would be taken to a list of different coffees. Clicking on any of these coffees would open up a detail page, which gives more information about the coffee, as well as the recipe. There would be different sections here. One section has information about the coffee - it would also contain the Like and Drink buttons. Clicking on any of these buttons generates a corresponding story on the user's Timeline. Another section would list the recipe, along with the Make button - clicking the Make button generates a corresponding story. 

Bootstrap and jQuery would be used. A lot.
